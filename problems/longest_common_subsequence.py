"""
Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them.
A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.
 For example, "abc", "abg", "bdf", "aeg", â€˜"acefg", .. etc are subsequences of "abcdefg".

LCS for input Sequences "ABCDGHI" and "AEDFHRK" is "ADH" of length 3.
LCS for input Sequences "SAGGTAB" and "PGXTXAYB" is "GTAB" of length 4.
