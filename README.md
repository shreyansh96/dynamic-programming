## Dynamic Programming

#### Memoization Recipe

1. Develop a functional code.
-  Visualize the problem as a tree.
-  Implement the tree using recursion
-  Test it out.

2. Work on Optimality
- Add a memo object - array, dictionary, etc.
- Add a base case to return memo values, leaf nodes of the tree.
- Store return values into the memo.

Solutions in Python 3.9

There are multiple solutions presented to the same problem, all solutions are encapsulated  in a class.

By default it will run all the solutions and compare execution times.

For simplicity, The execution should be done from home directory, simply run  
`python main.py`

This will run all the solutions, modify it accordingly.

For advanced users, you can set your path in IDE, and run the files directly.
